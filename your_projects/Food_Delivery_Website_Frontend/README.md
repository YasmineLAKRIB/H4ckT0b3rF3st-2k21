# Moumita-s-Cuisine-Frontend-
 It is basically a static Frontend Food Delivery website where an user can browse through the menu list and order different kinds of food items.
 Backend is under maintenance which would be using MySQL as a database.
 The UI have been made to look good with the contrast of the food and is fully responsive.
 You are also invited to collab with me in building the backend of this website then will finally deploy and launch it.
