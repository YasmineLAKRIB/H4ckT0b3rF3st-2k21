# Arduino PWM LED DIMMER

a simple project that shows how to Dim a LED with PWM using the Arduino UNO micro-controller

## Requirements

These are the softwares/hardwares you will need:

1. Arduino Uno
2. Arduino IDE 
3. Arduino USB cable
4. One LED 
5. One 330 Ohm resistors
6. One Potentiometer
7. Jumper cables
8. A Breadboard

## Setup

1. Board installation:
